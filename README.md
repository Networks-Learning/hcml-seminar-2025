# Human-Centric Machine Learning Seminar @ RPTU (Winter 2025)

The Human-Centric Machine Learning seminar course focuses on reading and presenting recent research articles in human-centric machine learning, with a particular emphasis in
societal aspects of machine learning (fairness, accountability, transparency), human-ai collaboration and causality. The papers will cover both theoretical foundations, applications as well as empirical studies.

The seminar course is open for Master students.

## Course work

As a student, you are expected to read and present one research paper in one of the topics of human-centric machine learning and ask questions during the presentation of a different paper in the same topic by another student. There are various topics available for you to choose from; you can find more information in the "Available Topics" 
section below. To help with your presentation, you will do a practice presentation in front of the instructions, where they will give you feedback.

The presentations will be scheduled on 3-4 days during the Winter semester. As a student, you are expected to attend all the presentations and actively engage in discussions.

## Available topics
 
A list of available topics and papers is available TBD.

## Prerequisites

You are expected to be familiar with the fundamentals of Machine Learning. Only those students who have already passed one of the fundamental Machine Learning courses during the course of their master studies will be accepted to the seminar.
